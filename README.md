## What is this?

**BLOOM** is a project that aims to create TAS tools for compatible Godot games that are powerful, performant, and extensible.

**godot-bloommod** is a fork of [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot); it forms the core of BLOOM.

## What games are supported?

There are currently no games for which BLOOM-based TAS tools are publically availible.

Note that BLOOM is a tool for creating TAS tools and is not designed to work with a new game out of the box. As BLOOM is still early in development, many Godot features are not fully supported and per-game setup and customization is still required.
